# FOOTPRINT-BACK

This is the backend for a sample project found [here](https://github.com/vectorkt/tt-chkmrx-front)

Note that the .env variable cannot be found here, and most likely requires generation on the developer's part.

## APP Documentation

To run the APP you will two commands.

```
npm install
npm run serverStart
```

It should automatically listen on port 4000.

The test command is:

```
npm run test
```

If there are any issues, let me know, I'll deploy it somewhere.
